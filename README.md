 #Design Prompt

 **Design:** A Product Availability Webpage

 **For:** A Farm Website

 **To Help:** Farmers sell food to Consumers!

 #My Solution
I designed my solution with the idea of it being the most self explanatory possible
the farmers will have images that will make him understand which tab or menu or directory he is currently in. The product menu will have two button near each product image that will add more to his inventory in which clients can shop or remove item from shop if he doesn't want to sell the product anymore. We can also see a profile and settings as well as statistics tab where he can either modify his profile, check the settings of the page or see his sales statistics.
